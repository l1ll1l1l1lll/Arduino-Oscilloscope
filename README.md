# Arduino-Oszillator

A simple Arduino-based oscilloscope capable of measuring voltage signals from **-10V to +10V**.

## Features
- Measurement range: **-10V ~ +10V**
- Arduino as the core sampling device
- Basic waveform visualization
- Great for beginners and small experiments

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno / Nano)
- Voltage divider and protection circuit (resistors, capacitors, etc. to keep input within safe range)
- 1.3 inch OLED Display

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Required libraries (depending on your display, e.g., `U8g2lib`)
